# "Lightweight" React Native Base Project

Includes:
* Redux for local state storage
* Apollo for GraphQL
* React Native Router Flux for routing

Everything's in `/app`

`react-native run-ios` to start in the simulator

This will be improved as react native matures and I learn more about it.

"Lightweight" because I can't call any modern JS development "lightweight" and keep a straight face ðŸ˜‚
